        <h2>"C is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success."</h2>
        <div class="details">
        <p>--> An American computer scientist who created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken
            Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language.</p>
        <p>--> Dennis M. Ritchie, American computer scientist and cowinner of the 1983 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour
            in computer science.</p>
        <p>--> He graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics and with a PhD in
            mathematics (1968). His contributions to computing span four decades and have had global impact.</p>
        <p>--> The C programming language and its descendants continue to be used to write the software that makes digital
            devices and networks work, while UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems run on a vast range of computing
            systems.
        </p>
        <p>--> Ritchie's early work laid the foundations for much of the technical infrastructure of our modern digital
            world. He enjoyed traveling and reading, but his main passion was his work, and he stayed with Bell Labs
            until his retirement in 2007. </p>
        <p>--> He passed away in 2011.</p>
